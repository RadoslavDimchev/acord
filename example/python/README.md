# Acord Python Examples

## Requirements

We have an amalgamated `reuquirements.txt` file that contains the required packages for all the examples. You can install it with:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

... or install them individually as needed with your favorite package manager under your favorite environment manager.


## Running the examples

* Make sure you have `acord` running
* `$ python <example>.py`

## Examples

* `stable-diffusion-gradio.py`: A simple example of a image generation based on Stable Diffusion equation with a gradio interface.
